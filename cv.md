### Code example

In this task, two lines of the form "13 September 2023 07:23" are passed to the function. I need to turn strings into dates, compare them. For the one that is bigger, get the day of the week and return it from the function.

```
function testDateTime(a, b) {
    var x = 0;
    var date1 = new Date (a);
    var date2 = new Date (b);
    var days = ["Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"];
    if (date1 > date2) 
    {
        var i = 0;
        i = date1.getDay();
        return days[i];
    }
    else 
    {
        var j = 0;
        j = date2.getDay();
        return days[j];  
    }
}
```

### Work experience

I have experience as a technical writer for almost a year and a half. Despite the unfamiliar field for me (engineering, instrumentation), I quickly joined the work and twice in the first year of work I received a promotion.

I worked for a company that manufactures telecommunications equipment, for example, explosion-proof intercoms suitable for nuclear power plants. Due to the specificity of the company's line of business, my work required a huge number of important points according to state standards.

I successfully coped with work: if I had free time, I helped colleagues with tasks. When I was fired, I received an offer from my superiors to return when I want, so you can judge that I am a valuable employee.
